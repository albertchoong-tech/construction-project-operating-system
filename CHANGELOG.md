# Changelog

All notable changes to HSH ProjectOS are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) from `1.0.0` onward.

Versioning was introduced retroactively in Sprint 11.5; the entries below `1.3.0`
map already-shipped sprints to the commits that delivered them. Sprint history and
specifications live in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [docs/BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md).

## [Unreleased]
- Sprint 12 — Notifications & Scheduled Automations (planned)

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-14 — In-app confirm/remarks modal
Branch `feature/action-button-modal`
### Changed
- `ActionButton` (approve / reject / cancel / delete / convert across the app) now opens an
  in-app modal for confirmation and the optional audit-remarks note, replacing the browser's
  native `confirm()` / `prompt()`. Consistent styling, an actual remarks textarea, Esc-to-cancel,
  and — unlike native dialogs — drivable by real end-to-end tests (Playwright). Same component
  API, so every call site is unchanged.
### Notes
- Diagnosed why these buttons can't be exercised in the automated preview pane: the app's
  authenticated `force-dynamic` pages don't become interactive there (content stays in React's
  streaming/Suspense hidden container; native `<form>` posts still work, JS-driven buttons don't).
  This is a preview-tooling limitation — production is unaffected (approvals run every sprint).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-12 — Reporting & Exports
Commit `3b5fbac` · migration `0006_reporting.sql` (applied live)
### Added
- `/reports` hub (Director + Finance only).
- Printable **monthly financial report** — money in/out, net cash movement, claims
  raised/certified, outstanding receivables/payables snapshot, month navigation.
- Printable **project cost report** — committed/actual/budget by cost centre with variance.
- **CSV exports** via role-gated API routes (`/api/reports/labour`, `/api/reports/payments`,
  `/api/reports/project-cost`) — 403 for non Director/Finance, RLS-scoped.
- Client-ready **progress-claim payment certificate**; claim numbers link to it.
- Print button on PO detail; cost-centre picker on the budget form.

### Release Engineering (Sprint 11.5)
- Git-flow branching (`main` / `develop` / `demo` / `feature/*`).
- GitHub Actions CI (typecheck + build) on PRs and pushes.
- This CHANGELOG, `docs/RELEASE.md`, and retroactive version tags.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-12 — Governance & Lifecycle
Commit `0cd957b` · migrations `0004_team_access.sql`, `0005_quotations.sql`
### Added
- **User & Access Administration** (Sprint 8) — `/team` page, project-membership-scoped
  RLS, `profiles` as the single source of truth for role + activation, hardened sign-up.
- **Quotation-to-Project** (Sprint 9) — `/quotations` module, draft→submit→approve→convert
  workflow copying line items into the BOQ, printable client-facing view.
- **Record Editing & Corrections** (Sprint 10) — edit forms for pre-approval records,
  PO cost-centre recategorisation, cancel-and-retain for approved PO/VO/claim, audit trail.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-09 — Field, Cost & Mobile
