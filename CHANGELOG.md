# Changelog

All notable changes to HSH ProjectOS are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) from `1.0.0` onward.

Versioning was introduced retroactively in Sprint 11.5; the entries below `1.3.0`
map already-shipped sprints to the commits that delivered them. Sprint history and
specifications live in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [docs/BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md).

## [Unreleased]
- Sprint 12 — Notifications & Scheduled Automations (planned)

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-12 — Reporting & Exports

### Added
- `/reports` hub (Director + Finance only).
- Printable **monthly financial report** — money in/out, net cash movement, claims

- Printable **project cost report** — committed/actual/budget by cost centre with variance.

- Client-ready **progress-claim payment certificate**; claim numbers link to it.
- Print button on PO detail; cost-centre picker on the budget form.

### Release Engineering (Sprint 11.5)
